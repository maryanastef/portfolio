# **Maryana Stefanyshyn - Data Analyst Portfolio**

## **About**

Hello! I am a data analyst with experience in gathering, organizing, and analyzing data to support business decisions using a variety of tools and technologies. I am proficient in Python, R, SQL, Excel, PowerBI, and Tableau and have a strong understanding of data analytics techniques such as dashboard building, report writing, data mining, data merging, statistics, and critical thinking. 

In this portfolio, I have included a range of projects that highlight my data analytics skills. You’ll discover links to the reports and dashboards I’ve made with programs like Tableau, PowerBI, and Excel. These projects demonstrate my ability to analyze and present data in a clear and visually appealing way, making it easy for decision-makers to understand insights and make smart decisions. 

I have also included my work in programming languages such as Python, R, and SQL. These projects demonstrate my ability to analyze complex data sets and extract valuable insights while combining multiple sources to produce a comprehensive view of the data. 

This is a repository to showcase my skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics/Data Science topics.
