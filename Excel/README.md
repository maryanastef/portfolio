# Data Analytics with Excel

In this folder, you will find a collection of dashboards that show the power and versatility of Microsoft Excel. 

Excel is a great tool for data analysis due to its intuitive interface and robust features. It allows users to clean, organize, and visualize data effectively using charts, graphs, and pivot tables. 

Excel's formulas and functions enable complex calculations and data manipulation, while its conditional formatting and data validation options enhance data presentation. With these capabilities, I was able to use Excel to transform raw data into actionable insights, making it a great tool for data analytics tasks.
