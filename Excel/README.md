# Data Analytics with Excel

In this folder, you will find a collection of dashboards that show the power and versatility of Microsoft Excel. 

Excel is a great tool for data analysis due to its intuitive interface and robust features. It allows users to clean, organize, and visualize data effectively using charts, graphs, and pivot tables. 

Excel's formulas and functions enable complex calculations and data manipulation, while its conditional formatting and data validation options enhance data presentation. With these capabilities, I was able to use Excel to transform raw data into actionable insights, making it a great tool for data analytics tasks.


## Projects:

* [Bike Sales Dashboard and Analysis](https://github.com/maryanastef/portfolio/blob/main/Excel/Bike_Sales_Dashboard.xlsx)

  Description: 
  * This dataset in the Bike Sales Dashboard contains sales data for different customers. The data includes the customer's marital status, gender, income, number of children, level of education, occupation, age, region, length of their commute, if they own a home, if they own a car, and if they have purchased a bike. 

  The dashboard is interactive and can be filtered by marital status, region, and level of education. 

  Results:
   * Overall, the data shows that more males own a bicycle than females. 
   * Married customers are making 6-10K more in their income and are more likely to purchase bicycles. 
   * Customers with longer commutes usually purchase cars instead of bicycles.
   * More single customers tend to purchase bikes than married customers.
