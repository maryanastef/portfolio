# Data Analytics with SQL

In this folder, you will find a collection of projects and resources that showcase the power and versatility of SQL in Data Analytics.

SQL is primarily used to query and retrieve data from relational databases. It allows data analysts to extract specific subsets of data from large datasets, making it easier to work with and analyze.

SQL is also used to clean and preprocess data by filtering out irrelevant records, handling missing values, and transforming data into a suitable format.

SQL provides powerful aggregation functions such as SUM, AVG, COUNT, etc. that enable data analysts to summarize and aggregate data to gain insights. This is especially useful for creating summary statistics and generating reports. SQL also allows data analysts to join tables based on common keys, facilitating the creation of comprehensive datasets for analysis.
